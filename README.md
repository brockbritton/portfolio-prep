- Building the innovative and ethical applications that move the world forward.
- It went okay. I have a lot of anxiety about speaking publicly. Even with it just being a screen i had a lot of trouble
- I love tech because it allows me to create almost anything. I can use my creativity and analytical thinking to build whatever I can dream of with a little hard work and perseverance.
